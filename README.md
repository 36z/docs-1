# Docs

*Documenting things related to the meshnet*

[cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) addresses a large number of complex issues in an elegant way. While efforts have been made to provide a default configuration that matches the greatest number of use cases, it is impractical to expect software to replace understanding.

> Enter the documentation project...

The good citizens of Hyperboria decided to put together this collection of documentation to help make the inner workings of cjdns more transparent.

We want you to [get involved](http://roaming-initiative.com/blog/posts/wtfm)! Feel free to submit pull requests.

See [index.md](index.md) for current progress. We'd love more languages!

## The scope of this project

We are interested in documenting a range of topics:

1. cjdns internals: bugs and features
2. operator culture and best practices
3. meshlocal resources
4. introductory literature
