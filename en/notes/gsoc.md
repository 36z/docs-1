## cjdns google summer of code

[Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page) has several goals:

1. Create and release open source code for the benefit of all
2. Inspire young developers to begin participating in open source development
3. Help open source projects identify and bring in new developers and committers
4. Provide students the opportunity to do work related to their academic pursuits (think "flip bits, not burgers")
5. Give students more exposure to real-world software development scenarios (e.g., distributed development, software licensing questions, mailing-list etiquette)

## Our goals

1. Get funding! Fixing cjdns is hard work, and it takes a lot of time. A precedent of funding from google might make it easier to pick up funding from other sources.
2. Get attention! People pay attention to projects that google funds. We need more eyes.
3. Structure! Hard deadlines get people moving. We'll get more done as a well-defined organization.
4. A working product... an android app? Something to improve the core routing algorithm? Debugging/visualization/simulation tools? Userland config management?
